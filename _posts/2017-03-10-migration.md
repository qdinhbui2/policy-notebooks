## Domestic Migration has declined

Best paper on is [this](https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2011/201130/201130pap.pdf). Table at the back is helpful. Big notes: in 1980, 3% of men used to move cross state lines, now its 1.7%. Young people still moving more, 5.1% to 3%.

Large net migration for young college graduates pulls [young people from rust belt to sun belt and west](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/upshot/the-states-that-college-graduates-are-most-likely-to-leave.html).

Low migration [may not be a bad thing](https://medium.com/migration-issues/declining-migration-may-be-good-news-f6203f9b9a11#.qtffps7bp).






## Why don't people move?

#### Labor markets are converging

Lyman does a decent write up of [this paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/iere.12209/asset/iere12209.pdf;jsessionid=B0BD5631CB11906AA3857C968CBE14A9.f04t04?v=1&t=j02zl283&s=0cc021d881fdb4016bd314cc319fb3a7ef61c2fa&systemMessage=Pay+per+view+article+purchase%28PPV%29+on+Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+on+Saturday+11th+March+from+05%3A00-14%3A00+GMT+%2F+12%3A00-09%3A00+EST+%2F+13%3A00-22%3A00+SGT+for+essential+maintenance.++Apologies+for+the+inconvenience.). But essentially the paper argues that declining migration may be a result of wages have started to converge between regions. Information has also converged. Fits well within converging labor markets thesis. But they look at wages, not unemployment. It could be the case the unemployment has not converged. So yes low migration makes sense when if you have a job because wages differentials are low. But what about people who don't have jobs? 

#### Costs at home? Disability? 

I've heard of papers here. Let's find them.

## Why All The Moving Statistics Might Be All Wrong
[Greg Kaplan](https://gregkaplan.uchicago.edu/sites/gregkaplan.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/minneapolis_fed_policy_papers.pdf) et make a point that the interstate migration data might be all due to the way the census imputes census figures. 

>In 2010, of every 100 people surveyed for the CPS, 87 said they hadn’t moved between states, 1 said they had moved between states, and 12 didn’t answer questions about migration. What we assume about those 12 people out of every hundred matters a lot: If they all migrated, the migration rate would be much higher than if none of them migrated. We could ignore the 12 entirely—and, in fact, we suggest later in this paper that ignoring the nonrespondents turns out to be a good solution in this case.

Census uses "hot deck" allocation to fill in the blanks. 
 > The Census Bureau uses a method called “hot deck allocation.” Participants’ survey forms are fed through a computer one at a time. If someone didn’t answer a particular question, the computer looks back through the forms it processed previously until it finds the most recently processed survey participant who’s similar to the nonrespondent but who did answer the question. The previously processed forms are called the hot deck. 

 >Let’s say Mr. Smith, a 33-year-old black homeowner living in the Midwest, didn’t answer a particular question. The computer might look through the hot deck for the most recently processed 33-year-old black homeowner in the Midwest who did answer—Mr. Jones, say—and then copy Mr. Jones’ answer onto Mr. Smith’s form. The person whose missing answer is filled in is known as a recipient; the person whose answer is used is known as a donor. The process is called imputation through hot deck allocation.

Before 2006, the order that the data were fed into the machine did not matter, so records could be from all over the place. The problem is that if you left the question, "did you move" blank, and the machine finds another person in the deck who said they moved, that person will more likely be from a different state and therefore be artifically classified as a interstate move. 

The upside. It doesn't change any large scale conclusions about migrations It's still declining. It's only a small data effect that last between 1999 and 2006 at the worst. Even if you don't impute those records, the trend is still down.
