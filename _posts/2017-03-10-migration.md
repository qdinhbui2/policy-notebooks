## Domestic Migration has declined

Best paper on is [this](https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2011/201130/201130pap.pdf). Table at the back is helpful. Big notes: in 1980, 3% of men used to move cross state lines, now its 1.7%. Young people still moving more, 5.1% to 3%.

Large net migration for young college graduates pulls [young people from rust belt to sun belt and west](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/upshot/the-states-that-college-graduates-are-most-likely-to-leave.html).

Low migration [may not be a bad thing](https://medium.com/migration-issues/declining-migration-may-be-good-news-f6203f9b9a11#.qtffps7bp).






## Why don't people move?

#### Labor markets are converging

Lyman does a decent write up of [this paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/iere.12209/asset/iere12209.pdf;jsessionid=B0BD5631CB11906AA3857C968CBE14A9.f04t04?v=1&t=j02zl283&s=0cc021d881fdb4016bd314cc319fb3a7ef61c2fa&systemMessage=Pay+per+view+article+purchase%28PPV%29+on+Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+on+Saturday+11th+March+from+05%3A00-14%3A00+GMT+%2F+12%3A00-09%3A00+EST+%2F+13%3A00-22%3A00+SGT+for+essential+maintenance.++Apologies+for+the+inconvenience.). But essentially the paper argues that declining migration may be a result of wages have started to converge between regions. Information has also converged. Fits well within converging labor markets thesis. But they look at wages, not unemployment. It could be the case the unemployment has not converged. So yes low migration makes sense when if you have a job because wages differentials are low. But what about people who don't have jobs? 

#### Costs at home? Disability? 

I've heard of papers here. Let's find them.
