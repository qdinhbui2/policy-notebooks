### Basic Figures

* Labor force: people who working or looking for work. 

* Is roughly 63% if you count EVERYONE--every old man, old women, child. Obviously the children and elderly don't count. 

* If you look only at prime-age workers 25-54 (pop is 120 million ish), that participation rises to 79%

### Trends

The labor force participation rate has fell steeply since the beginning of the recession. Some people are worried that this is an indication that otherwise productive people are being left behind. Discouraged is the term economists use. The concensus is that is retirement and schooling. 

In debates like these people don't make a strong distinction between the two. It's preferable to look at prime-age workers, its cleaner. You're less likely to have retirement or close-to-retirement distortions. It's safe to say that between 25-54 you have to be doing something. 

### Similar Contours

What's puzzling is that the contours for the rate between prime-age ppl and all ppl are similar. Except at the end when the rate for prime-age people is recovering while the rate for all is not. It suggests (I have to check this with an economist) is that the recession pushed people to retire, go to school, or out of work. And we're building back up to place (not completely) where we started. The reason why we won't ever get back to the participation rates that we had in 2007 is because of aging populations.

The problem with all age range and the prime ages range is that it is somewhat double counting. You get prime-age with the all age! No one (to my knowledge) has done a participation rate for ppl 55-65 and +. 

It would be interesting to do a chart, breaking down these categories. ALL + Children + Old People + Prime Age. (Kreguer does some of it below but his charts have different scales!)

Bill McBride is good on the data [part](http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2016/11/update-prime-working-age-population.html). 

But this leads me to my next point, which is that as of 2016 there are only 1.3 million prime-age who left the labor force because they can't find a job. If you roll your own CPS numbers. 


### Lost Men

They tend to be 10 percent more male. This is the worry that many people have about forgotten men. Or men left behind. It's captured the imagination of the news. But in the grand scheme of things it's relatively small. 1-2 percent. And it may be true that these men might be lost. 

Krueger has a [good paper](file:///Users/207136/Downloads/Alan-B-Krueger%20(2).pdf) on the reasons why they might be lost (hint: its opiates). Also he agrees with the literature and finds that most of the decline in the labor force are demographic: "mainly a result of an aging population and ongoing trends that preceded the Great Recession, such as increased school enrollment." Men are the biggest priority: he finds that nearly half of these men have poor health and take pain meds daily.
