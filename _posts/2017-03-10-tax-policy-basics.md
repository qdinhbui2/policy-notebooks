## [What Kinds of Taxes Are There?](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-are-federal-taxes-distributed)


1) Individ. income tax

2) Payroll tax: taxes that come off your paycheck. Employers and employees must pay a portion. 

3) Corporate Taxes. "Income from capital (e.g., dividends, rents, interest, and capital gains) bears four-fifths of the burden, with wages and other sources of labor income bearing the remaining fifth."

4) Estate tax

5) Excise tax: taxes you pay when you use something.

## Who tends to pay each tax?

Good charts here: http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/are-federal-taxes-progressive

Income and Corporate taxes are progressive. 

The richest pay the highest effective tax rate: 33.4%+ for top 1 percent. 

The average tax rate is 20.1%. Poor people on average get back 4.7% of income taxes back.

Payroll Taxes and Excise taxes are regresssive. The curve of payroll taxes hurt the upper middle class the most. The averge payroll tax rate == 6.9%. 


## What is a good measure of progressivity?

[good content](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-should-progressivity-be-measured)

The percentage change in after-tax income is the most reliable measure of the progressivity of such a change. You are directly measuring the amount of resources available to a person. 

Other ways are ambigous. 


## How to measure distributional analysis

1) Its hard to measure if people actually get taxed. Corporate taxes are guilty of this. Rich corporate tax people often avoid these taxes.

2) It's hard to get a bead on what "income" actually is. Do you measure Medicaid, Medicare, housing subsidies? As a result some people argue that you should measure consumption. It's more concrete and includes some of these broader measures. 

3) Some tax provisions are extend over time. Most analyses look at one year, but what happens if your tax break is stretched over time? IRAs

4) Taxes vs spending. Admittedly, I don't quite understand all of this: 

> "The federal budget counts amounts paid as refundable credits on the expenditure side of the ledger, but all standard distributional analyses classify those amounts as (negative) taxes. Similarly, all analyses effectively reduce tax burdens by the special exemptions, deductions, tax rates, and credits that represent “tax expenditures,” which arguably should be counted as budget outlays rather than as tax reductions. Including these outlays in the analyses understates the true burden of taxes."

5) Most tax analyses do not look at 2nd order effects to the economy.


## What is dynamic scoring?

Every bill that effects the budget > .25% of GDP needs a macroeconomic [score](http://budget.house.gov/macroeconomicscoring/macroeconomic-scoring-qa.htm) from the CBO. 

For many years, however, CBO and JCT budget scores did not account for the secondary impact on employment, gross domestic product, and other macroeconomic measures. The agencies often analyzed those macroeconomic impacts separately in what is called dynamic analysis, but did not include their feedback effects in official scores. An exception is immigration reform scoring: the effects on population and labor force are so direct that CBO and JCT did account for them. http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-are-dynamic-scoring-and-dynamic-analysis

In 2015, congress enacted legistlation that enforced dynamic scoring. Official 2nd order macro feedback was finally allowed. First the JCT and CBO do normal conventional scoring that is more or less static. Then they estimate the feedbacks. 

Sometimes the effects are marginal, sometime the effects are large.

Dynamic feedbacks are hard to estimate. You have to account, correctly, how different agents in the economy will react. The model is very sensistive.

## Who bears the burden of the corporate income tax?

TPC assumes that corporate tax burden is 80/20 mix. 80% goes to capital income, 20% wage income.

## Who bears the burden of the excise tax tax?

http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/who-bears-burden-federal-excise-taxes

When you levy an excise tax, you're going reduce real HH income. You change the mix of some goods relative to other goods.
