## What is gender based budgeting? 
Budgets should ideally affect genders the same amount. But often budgets don't take on board which programs proposed or cut could disproportionately affect genders. According to [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21717404-designing-fiscal-policies-support-gender-equality-good-growth-why) Diane Elson is one of the "originators" of gender budgeting. 

## How does it work?
It looks for programs that affect a higher proportion of women than men (like TK). A good example the economist article brings up is how we think about accounting. Governments tend to think of infrastructure spending as an investment, while social programs are thought of as a cost. Yet both employ people -- they just tend to be different genders.

In some developing countries these budgets can be explicit. 

## Big questions

1. How do you do a gender budget? 
	From WBG -- essentially take a look at any budget expenditure and see which gender it affects.
	From WBG -- 
2. What are more examples like infrastructure and spending?

		Care economy
	* What I imagine it to be:
		See how spending splits between man and women
		See how taxes spending or raises split between man and women
		See what kind of regulations
		Look at effects of education on boys and girls 
		Look at 2nd order effects that cuts to services have on women's labor market choices
		Look at 2nd order effects 

3. How do you implement gender budgeting? What are the appropriate trade-offs?

	* History in Australia in the 1980s. 
	* Elson criticized IMF and World Bank, finding that burdens of austerity disproportionately fell on women.
	* Market and household labor were not taken into account when austerity impacts were measured. Since public services tend to benefit mothers and their homes. 
	* More than 80 countries do it.
		Austria is an interesting example. It wrote tax reform that tried to encourage more women to work.
		Belgium ministry of justice looked at prisons policies for women. Also passed a law that makes all policies and laws to assesed basd on gender. They also have sex-disaggregated data.
	* Methodology
		Extend models of the household incorporate labor market effects (market and non-market labor)
		Look at education
		Loook at health (but it is hard)
		Disaggregate who gets what by sex. Services like water and electric notwithstanding. 
		Taxes:
