## What is gender based budgeting? 
Budgets should ideally affect genders the same amount. But often budgets don't take on board which programs proposed or cut could disproportionately affect genders. According to [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21717404-designing-fiscal-policies-support-gender-equality-good-growth-why) Diane Elson is one of the "originators" of gender budgeting. 

## How does it work?
It looks for programs that affect a higher proportion of women than men (like TK). A good example the economist article brings up is how we think about accounting. Governments tend to think of infrastructure spending as an investment, while social programs are thought of as a cost. Yet both employ people -- they just tend to be different genders.

In some developing countries these budgets can be explicit. 

## Big questions

1. How do you do a gender budget? 
	* I did not find that these articles were helpful. They seemed to say very obvious things.
		* [Gender Budgeting: Fiscal Context and Current Outcomes](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/	wp/2016/wp16149.pdf)  
		* [Gender budgeting: practical implementation](http://www2.unwomen.org/-/media/files/un%20women/grb/resources/gender%20budgeting%20practical%20implementation%20handbook.pdf?vs=1030)

	* But this is what I imagine it to be:
		* See how spending splits between man and women
		* See how taxes spending or raises split between man and women
		* See what kind of regulations
		* Look at effects of education on boys and girls 
		* Look at 2nd order effects that cuts to services have on women's labor market choices
		* Look at 2nd order effects
		* Include non market hours (ideal)

2. What are more examples like infrastructure and spending?

3. How do you implement gender budgeting? What are the appropriate trade-offs?



## Good Resources

* [Gender Budgeting: Fiscal Context and Current Outcomes](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2016/wp16149.pdf)
	* History in Australia in the 1980s. 
	* Elson criticized IMF and World Bank, finding that burdens of austerity disproportionately fell on women.
	* Market and household labor were not taken into account when austerity impacts were measured. Since public services tend to benefit mothers and their homes. 
	* More than 80 countries do it.
		Austria is an interesting example. It wrote tax reform that tried to encourage more women to work.
		Belgium ministry of justice looked at prisons policies for women. Also passed a law that makes all policies and laws to assesed basd on gender. They also have sex-disaggregated data.
	* Methodology
		Extend models of the household incorporate labor market effects (market and non-market labor)
		Look at education
		Loook at health (but it is hard)
		Disaggregate who gets what by sex. Services like water and electric notwithstanding. 
		Taxes: 




## For the United States


The federal government spends 3.7 trillion dollars.

3.2 is raised by federal revenues (taxes mostly)

.4 is raised by borrowing.

Largest topline expenditures


These are mandatory

	- Defense and international security assistance
		- $602 billion dollars
			- We don't know exactly what the gender incidence for contractors for capital. 
			- But we (probably?) know the gender for labor
			- A conservative estimate would be to split proportionally
			- But clearly the military is probably top-heavy gender-wise
