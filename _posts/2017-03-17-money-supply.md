## How Banks Creates Money
Banks create money through increasing their deposits. 

They increase their deposits through loans. 

The amount of money they can loan is is limited by the reserve ratio set by Federal Reserve. If the reserve ratio is 10%, then an initial $1,000 deposit at one bank, will turn into another $900 loan to another person. That person will deposit that sum into another bank. That other bank will loan out $810 to then another person....so on and so forth. 

In general, the sum of money created through a deposit is: 

``` D/(1-L) ```

Where D is the initial deposit, and L is the share of funds you can loan once you subtract the reserve requirement.

Making that $1,000 deposit multiply into $10,000 of loanable funds.

This is the idea behind fractional reserve banking. Banks hold a fraction of the deposits and loan out the rest. The fraction required to be held is determined by the Fed. Each decimal of the reserve requirement has a multiplier.

## ...But Are Limited By The Fed
Think of the reserve requirement is an idea in principle. The actual way the Fed controls the reserve requirement has changed over time. [Currently reserve requirement is 10%](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm). In fact banks tend to hold more money than the Fed requires. In 2008, the Fed started paying banks interest on money they held above the [reserve requirement](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reqresbalances.htm).

Good words [here](http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2010/11/interest-on-reserves-on-inflation.html):

> The tool the Fed has for removing reserves from the system is open market operations (QEI and QEII are essentially traditional open market operations, but the Fed buys long-term rather than the more traditional short-term financial assets). So why do they need another tool -- interest on reserves -- to control reserves? Removing reserves too fast through open market operations could disrupt financial markets. Paying interest on reserves gives the Fed a way to remove reserves in a more leisurely fashion while still maintaining control over inflation. They can raise the interest rate on reserves freezing them within the banking system, and then remove the reserves over time through open market operations as desired.


But traditionally the the Fed controls the fed funds rate (the amount of money banks charge enough other) through open market operations. The market for reserve funds is controlled by the Fed because it controls the supply of reserves. But recently this has changed in pretty odd ways that I have to references over and over again.
