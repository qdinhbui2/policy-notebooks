## Brookings Challenges to Mismeasurement in US productivity slowdown

((needed here, how to measure productivity?))


### Jan Hatzius
[Goldman Sachs slides]()

Specifically speaking, he's talking about the slowdown in productivity, not the gap between productivity and wages. 

He asks us to really investigate the implications of a slowdown in productivity. If our people were actually becoming really less productive than in the past, what would our economy look like? 



He uses the 70s as an example, where TK and TK led to a undisputed slowdown in productivity. We saw TK and TK. That's not what we're seeing today. 

So if you cut down a tree and it doesn't fall, did it really happen? So if the consequences of low productivity are not bearing out, is it actually happening?

Instead the explanation that Hatzius is more partial to is in data. Specifically the data we're using to gauge output is particularly good at measuring the stuff we're good at making.

The data (especially in computer systems) fall short. There are big gains in innovation and sectoral size into software, a sector which we tend to be not very good at measurement. 
 
 > "So, a big shift in the direction of things that are harder to measure and, of course, if something’s harder to measure, then the default assumption is, if you don’t have good criteria, to basically assume that prices haven’t changed significantly in quality adjusted terms, and that is essentially what we see. If you look at the deflater’s for these different sub-sectors we see a big drop cumulatively in computer and electronics manufacturing and in the official price indices, but basically no changes in any of the other sectors."

 He has a pretty good thought experiment:

 > ...we’ve moved into sectors where the official price indices don’t really show any deflation, so the official indices basically say that if you spend $100 on software now, you’re still getting essentially the same amount of real value as you did 10 or 20 years ago, which to me seems quite implausible.

 But he doesn't think that tech is the whole story. Part of this has to do with healthcare. Hatzius believe that the improvements in healthcare are undermeasured. 

 > Alan Blinder says when he speaks to large audiences he likes to ask them whether they would prefer today’s healthcare, today’s nominal prices, or 1975 quality healthcare at 1975 nominal prices and the vast majority say they want today’s healthcare.


### Chad Syverson
He cites the ebb and flow of productivity growth

1947 -1973 2.7% 1974 -1994 1.6% 1995 -2004 2.8% 2005 -2015 1.3%

He argues if we grew between 2005 and 2015 the same rate we grew the decade before, then GDP would be 3 trillion higher, 9,200 per capita richer. Essentially the whole healthcare sector. He argues that if we're mismeasuring, we're mismeasuring by that magnitude. 

Looking across countries, we're seeing productivity growth slow (except for Spain) and there's no relationship with broadband access. 

Looking ath micreconomic literature that tries to capture consumer surplus, you don't get near $3 trillion. Largest estimate is 850bn.

If you had IT sectors grow at a rate that gets you to $3 trillion, then you'd have sectoral growth never before seen in the history of mankind.

> If you want to explain the slowdown, you have to say it’s more than just GDP is mis-measured. You have to say there has to be a systematic change in mis-measurement, starting around 2004 and, moreover, that change has to go in a certain direction.

He believes that the mismeasurement is real but not total.

## Other Takes @ Brookings

> In the Consumer Price Index a smartphone is no different than a cell phone and so there’s been no increase in productivity from that sector in many years.

> We need to be able to expand the kind of ways that we quality adjust prices for things that are like Swiss Army knives that do multiple things. And if we did that, I think we’d make a big contribution to the way the productivity is measured in the Unites States.

> So it cost $80 to get a concert ticket and now you can buy a long-playing record, okay? But you can listen to a symphony either way. So to do this honestly, we’d have to go back in time and that leaves open the question of whether we’re mis-measuring productivity any more than we’ve always mis-measured productivity?

Though the we've always mismeasured productivity so why are we worried about it now argument seems soft to me. What if its different this time? What if computers are so incredibly different in terms of productivity gains that they have the capacity to distort our statistics in a way washing machines couldn't? Or at least do it at a pace that leave our government and experts confused? Adoption and cloud computing has been able distribute productivity gains extradorinarily fast. 

Think of it this way, in the past, even while washing machines were so extraordinarily useful, they still require people to buy them. So our economy eased into the new productivity. But with computers. We got those gains almost instantly.


### Robert Z. Lawrence's Take

 [chapter in this big AEI paper](https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/The-US-Labor-Market.pdf)


Why might productivity be mis-measured? Looking at the gap between Output per hour, non farm vs real hourly compensation, nonfarm.

#### Argument 1
We measure gross output not net output. Gross output doesn't take into account depreciation of capital. 

If we believe that the machine we used to make things don't last as long as they used to, then the depreciation of those machines will play a big role in net output.

Using gross output would make numerator in output/labor, seem artificially large. 

We need to take into account part time workers too? ( I was not aware that labor productivity statistics were not doing this)

Lawrence argues that these two things, depreciation and including PT would eliminate 20### of the gap.


### Argument 2

We are not taking into account total compensation. If you add benefits into compensation, then you explain 8.2% of the gap. 


### Agrument 3 

What kind of pay are we talking about. We are not including new forms of pay like stock options, commissions, and bonuses. 

This is a big deal for executives. If you include this then you explain 30% of the gap.


### Argument 4

Deflators: people are aren't buying the things that they make. This is kind of a weird argument. The argumengt goes like this: 

The thing that we're producing and putting all of our innovation in are things that we rarely consume. So consumer prices are not going to fully take on board how much lower prices of computers are. So when I deflate nominal wages with CPI, real wages are going to grow slower than if I deflate with a PCE which is more flexible consumption basket and more comprehensive. 

Lawrence argues that this fix, using PCE instead of CPI would explain 35% of the gap.



## Good [post](http://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2017/03/differing-productivity-across-us.html) on different productivities by sector.

Writes up this BLS [story](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2017/article/economic-productivity-in-the-air-transportation-industry.htm) that's mostly on the aviation industry. But what is helpful is the big table on multifactor productivity KLEMS (K=capital, L=labor, E=energy, M=materials). Education is at the bottom, it grew less productive by 3 percent.

I asked Tim about this and he says that it's probably a combination of rising costs in education and the fact that we don't know how to measure output (the numerator) properly.
