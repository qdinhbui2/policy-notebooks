## JEP paper from [Joel Mokyr et al](https://sites.northwestern.edu/jmokyr/files/2016/06/The-History-of-Techn-Anxiety-and-the-Future-of-Econ-Growth-Is-This-Time-Different-1rlbgzi.pdf) is smart here.

A good frame when thinking about tech anxiety is....

1. How much people will work on average. 

2. How will that work will be distributed. 

### Over the long term hours for workers have fallen.
> Hours fell, from roughly 2,950 hours per worker in 1870 to 1,500 hours per worker in 1998. Since 2000, OECD figures show another decline: the OECD average fell by 75 hours worked per year (although less in the United States). For economists, it would seem peculiar to fret too much about a long-term decline in work hours: indeed, the earlier discussion pointed out that there is a tradition of economists either forecasting or hoping that technology would reduce the need for work hours.


### Flip the idea. How have the avenues for leisure expanded? How have the hours changed?

> And as mentioned above, Keynes (1930) noted that with the decline of work, man must face the problem of how to occupy his leisure… One of the underappreciated aspects of twentieth-century technological progress has been the increased marginal utility of leisure through increases in the variety of leisure and declines in the cost of leisure-directed techniques. Of course, the ultimate value of leisure activities is a matter of judgment. 

> However, it is no stretch to submit that it may be a net gain to human welfare to have fewer hours spent on a job, driving along US interstate highways, or selling tokens in a London Underground station and more hours using modern technology: for example, to watch dramas or sports of a mind-boggling variety on a high-definition flat screen; to attend virtual rock concerts or operas with high-quality sound; 44 Journal of Economic Perspectives to defeat the Trojans or win the tank battle of Kursk from a living room sofa using a joystick; or to “network” with friends through social media. 

### Mokyr et al comment on the missing leisure class in America. 

> The United States was historically unusual in lacking this class, and European “visitors to the Northern States commented on the drawn faces and frantic busyness of Jacksonian Americans” and the absence of a leisure class (Rodgers 1978, p. 5). *What makes today different is the fact that so much high-quality leisure activity can be accessed by all at low average cost and near-zero marginal cost.*

### How will work (or leisure) will be distributed. 

These values are clearly unequal. People with little education get few work hours and many leisure hours, most of it spent watching TV (Aguiar and Hurst).

People who are the most educated and most productive tend to work more. From a strict economics standpoint, their hours are marginally worth more. They give up up more money to the equivalent hour of leisure then a less productive, less educated, less well paid worker.

There is also an open question as to what counts as work and what counts as leisure. There are many jobs where the distinction becomes blurry and others when it is abundantly clear.

Mokyr also suggests that the difference might not be driven by the educated to work more, but a demand side problem from employers. 

>  Many middle-skill jobs, both in manufacturing plants and in offices, have tended to be more susceptible to automation 

This leads middle skilled workers to bid for low skilled jobs, creating a crunch for work. Mokyr doesn't think that it robots will take over BOTH comparatively and absolutely.

### The Tech Horizon

It's going to be hard, if not impossible, to gauge how much time each industry has. But what is different today is that the spread of tech is faster than it was in the past. Tech progress will always be with us as countries continue to compete w/ each other.

 > New findings can rapidly be transmitted across the global networks of science and research. As Ridley (2010) pointed out, “The cross-fertilization of ideas between, say, Asia and Europe that once took years, decades, or centuries can now happen in minutes while Australia, the Americas, and Africa eavesdrop.

But Mokyr believes public policy is need to help. People may need a hand with housing, food and education through redistribution.
