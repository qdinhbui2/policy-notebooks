## How can life expectancy in American can be so low when it spends so much? Are health costs related to things other than medical care?

Max Roser's chart is the best on this.

## [Rand paper on social determinants of health](http://www.rand.org/blog/rand-review/2017/02/what-are-the-social-determinants-of-health.html)

Rand paper suggests that rooted in this gap might be not be medical heathcare per say. But it might be social problems like housing, unemployment segregation etc. Premised on this idea is that you can't fix health care simply with a scapel.

Using a cross country analysis, [Rand found](http://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/projects/are-better-health-outcomes-related-to-social-expenditure-.html): "Every percentage-point increase in overall spending invested in social-welfare programs was associated with 18 more days of life, on average, for every man, woman, and child."

> Those social programs ranged from child care allowances to rent subsidies to unemployment benefits. But the strongest health outcomes were linked to public pensions and other old-age benefits—and in some surprising ways. Countries that spent more on old-age programs tended to have longer life expectancies, but also lower levels of infant mortality. One possible explanation: Those old-age programs might serve as a marker of the overall strength of the social safety net.

> The study found stronger health links with government spending than with private or charity spending. It found those impacts were especially pronounced in places with high levels of social and economic inequality. And it found the same pattern when it zoomed in on the United States: Individual states that spend more on public-welfare programs tend to have better health.

> A 2009 study, for example, found that people in low-income neighborhoods show more signs of physical [“wear and tear,”](http://www.rand.org/pubs/external_publications/EP20100115.html) such as high blood pressure. A more recent study found that people living in wealthier neighborhoods have [lower rates of heart disease.](http://www.rand.org/pubs/external_publications/EP51145.html)


## Wasteful Healthcare Spending

Tim Taylor has helpful [post](http://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2017/02/wasteful-health-care-spending.html) which writes up an OECD paper on wasteful healthcare spending. Some good ideas here: 

> Looking at a range of studies and evidence, they offer this list of "common areas of overdiagnosis or overtreatment": 
* Imaging for low back pain.
* Imaging for headaches.
* Antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infection.
* Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (used to measure bone mineral density).
* Preoperative testing in low-risk patients (electrocardiography, stress electrocardiography, * chest radiography).
* Antipsychotics in older patients.
* Artificial nutrition in patients with advanced dementia or advanced cancer.
* Proton pump inhibitors in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.
* Urinary catheter placement.
* Cardiac imaging in low-risk patients.
* Induction of labour.
* Cancer screening (cervical smear test, CA-125 antigen for ovarian cancer, prostate-specific * antigen screening, mammography).
* Caesarean section.
