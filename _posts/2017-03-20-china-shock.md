## [Feenstra finds a simple problem](http://cid.econ.ucdavis.edu/Papers/Feenstra-Ma-Xu-3-17-2017.pdf):

### The Intuition
There is an omitted variable: housing. 

Feenstra claims that the employment effects halve and become somewhat insignificant if you include changes in housing prices. 

The idea is that between 2000 and 2007, weakness in the labor market were covered up with a frothy construction boom. This is what was found in Charles, Hurst, and Notowidigdo. 

Feenstra claims taht the commuting zones with the largest import exposure also had "smaller" increases in housing prices. The idea being that labor market was bad for everyone, but ADH could only detect the damage in CZs where home prices were tepid and then misattributed that the magnitude of the damage to Chinese import  competition.

> These altered results are obtained because housing prices act as an omitted variable in the regressions, and as shown in Figure 1, the change in this variable is negatively correlated with the change in Chinaâ€™s import exposure especially over 2000-2007. In other words, regions of the country that experienced the greatest 9See note 12 for the calculation of jobs lost outside of the manufacturing sector. 17 increase in housing prices, like in California and Florida, had smaller import exposure from China as compared to other regions, like in the Midwest. The housing construction accompanying the rise in prices means that the difference between employment changes in nonmanufacturing employment between these regions was amplified, thereby leading to an upward bias (in absolute value) of the total employment or unemployment coefficients in our regressions. Housing boom started between 2000-2007 and China gained acession to the WTO in 2001, the timing of the claim makes sense.



### The Results

The decline in manufacturing employment held (-.529**) but the non-manufacturing employment reverse. Non-manufacturing employment particularly benefitted college graduates. This offset the total employment losses by half by CZ.

So the idea is that Chinese import competition still hurts manufacturing workers, but the lack of housing prices undersold the job benefits to COLLEGE GRADUATES! And thus overestimated total job losses by almost 2.

> Thus the net reduction in total US employment due to rising Chinese import exposure was about 0.83 million workers, or less than one-half of that implied by the estimates in ADH (2013). This striking contrast comes mainly from the different response from the nonmanufacturing sector. In particular, rising Chinese import exposure led to a negligible reduction in noncollege nonmanufacturing jobs (0.066 million), while it increased employment for college nonmanufacturing workers by 0.56 million.

### Why Did This Happen?

The idea is that when jobs are destroyed, some new jobs are made. But perhaps not for the same people.

> Beyond the difference in the magnitude of job losses between our estimates and theirs, the message of our paper is that the China shock caused offsetting job gains in the nonmanufacturing sector for college educated workers. This is a surprising finding because we have not calculated the employment gains due to increased US exports to China, but rather, we continue to work with the exposure to Chinese imports as proposed by ADH (2013). Of course, for general equilibrium reasons, resources that are freed up due to import competition can be expected to be re-employed, with some lag, into export or domestic activities. The data from ADH (2013) suggest that some employment opportunities in the nonmanufacturing sector were created by the China shock, and exploring this topic further is an important direction for further research.




### What Erik Hurst said

Set the backdrop: his paper is on whether the housing boom masked the inherent weakness in the labor market. Typically housing prices and a strong labor market go hand in hand. If people have jobs, they buy houses and drive up the prices of homes. But between 2000 and 2007, that relationship wasn't exactly the case. Housing was caught in a bubble: home prices went up because people thought prices were going to go up, not necessarily because people were getting more jobs. 

But this possibility made it really to distinguish which was which. Did the labor market actually recover, or did it recover because of the housing boom. To do that he used an instrument, a variable unrelated to the primary variable of interest (in this case manufacturing) but is related to variable that you want to explore (like housing)


This complication is what Feenstra argues is what is missing from ADH's analysis. How much of the effect that ADH detected from import competition from China and how much of it was affected by the housing boom. Logic is that the housing boom exaggerated the difference in employment between areas deeply affected by Chinese imports and areas there were not. 

Erik Hurst still believes that Chinese imports did have an effect on manufacturing employment. "David wants to put a number on it. I believe that's its a chunk and its not an insignificant chunk. But specifically how much it is, I don't know."

While the logic may be sound, he finds the outcomes of Feenstra's paper puzzling. Feenstra finds that while manufacturing employment still falls as a result of Chinese imports non-manufacturing employment actually rises. Employment in different industries are all related, to the extent that when there is a rise employment in a big sector like manufacturing, it leads to a rise in employment in other sectors in a local economy. Workers with more money buy homes, go to grocery stores, etc employing other workers. The fact that manufacturing was hit hard in these regions yet at the same time saw a rise in employment elsewhere is at odds with this idea. "It's surprising, Feenstra uses our paper as an anchor, but then come to a conclusion that is completely different."
