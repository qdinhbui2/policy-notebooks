## Why are Healthcare Costs So High?

probably should also read this report in 2013 from [nyt](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/health/colonoscopies-explain-why-us-leads-the-world-in-health-expenditures.html?pagewanted=all)

Interesting analysis by McKinsey, [writeup by Aaron Carrol](http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/what-makes-the-us-health-care-system-so-expensive-inpatient-care/)

Big idea: Healthcare spending and GDP are intertwined. Richer countries pay more for healthcare, but the US pays much much than our per capita GDP would predict. Of that gap over the regression line, outpatient care is the biggest component.

Outpatient care costs (e.g. doctor’s visits) are the main component of our above average aggregate healthcare costs. 

After outpatient care, there are tiny other little components of above average healthcare spending.

### But Why Do Americans Spend More?

We spend more because our prices are higher. Why are our prices higher? One big reason is that we have a more unregulated market than other countries. This is counter-intuitive—in a well functioning free market, prices should get bid down to their marginal cost. But health is a very odd market. Demand for services is very inelastic, so suppliers of goods and services often get to charge much much more than their marginal cost. Insurance companies don’t have the market power to do this. 

For one, they can’t bargain across state lines. Health wonks warn that this would lead insurance companies to “race to the bottom”. Meaning that the plans that each insurance company offers will the be the plan that the state with the most lenient regulations will allow them to get away with. It’s interesting because this is a feature that a very healthy country does allow—Japan. But Japan also has very strict regulations over what insurance companies are required to offer. 

#### All Payer and Japan

Who does this? France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, and Switzerland

[Japan also offers an all-payer system](http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/31/5/1049.full.pdf+html). Insurances companies don’t negotiate prices. Instead, the prices are set by a panel that determines the national fee for each service every year. That is how they control the price. All payer systems are interesting because they’re nominally market oriented—people buy insurance off the market just like ours. But there are some small, but very important details that make this system work. 1) Employees must join the plan offered by their employer — there is no choice, 2) Nonemployed are obligated to join the government insurance plan offered by their government. 

This system helps balance out the moral hazard in insurance markets. Eg young people not buying health insurance until they’re sick. By requiring everyone to buy insurance, you balance out the risk pool.

But these strict regulations basically make an all-payer system feels very foreign to the American way of doing business. It seems like insurance companies and customers don’t really have much freedom to buy and sell their product. A market in name only.

#### Single Payer System
The government pays. 





### Market for Health

A common thread here is that you need an body large enough to negotiate prices down. It can be the government or some panel sets the price, but it doesn’t seem like (based on my 20 minutes of googling), that another framework exists that allows buyers of health care to get a lower price. 


#### Downsides
Prices are a good incentive for innovation and investment and is a good carrot to lure the best and brightest Americans to go into medicine. But on the margin, it doesn’t seem like those good incentives are translating into better outcomes. Maybe we don’t need gobs and gobs of money to be thrown at medical investment — maybe that’s not how the science works. Maybe we also don’t need the top 1% of college achievement to be our physicians and care providers. It doesn’t look like overall we’re getting much in return. Maybe their talents are better spent elsewhere. We’re not only misallocating resources from our pocketbooks but the valuable human and capital resources of our economy.
