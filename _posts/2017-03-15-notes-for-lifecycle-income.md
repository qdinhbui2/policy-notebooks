## Conclusions
Q1: Howmuch lifetime inequality exists in the United States today ? * A1: A lot! (relative to our prior.)

Q2: Howmuch has average lifetime income changed since the 1950s ? 
* A2: For three-quarters of population: None.

Q3: Howmuch has lifetime inequality changed since the 1950s ?
* A3: Lots of increase within gender groups. Little increase overall (thanks to shrinking lifetime gender gap!)
* A4: Most differences in income occur before age 25. 

## DATA

1. SSA Master File
	SSA Master Earnings File: Population data from1978 to 2013 – Wage/Salary income. No top coding. (SE income also available. Non-top-coded after 1993). – All workers in all 
	sectors. – Lifetime income for 6 cohorts. We combine them all in one.

	`Question: is there top-coding? Is there a cut-off?`

	Answer [here](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v69n3/v69n3p29.html) under "limitations"
	> Foremost, earnings data were first collected for the sole purpose of computing Social Security benefits. In the earlier years, only data on earnings up to the OASDI-taxable maximum were collected because any earnings over this amount did not factor into the benefit formula. 

2. CWHS Sample: 
	1% nationally representative panel from 1957 to 2013 (57 years). – Wage/Salary Income. Imputed above SSA taxable limit. – Commerce and Industry workers. 70% of labor force. – Lifetime (31 year) income for 27 cohorts.

Two samples:

- Social Security Administration records

- 57 years of data.

– Sample 0: All U.S. born individuals with an SSN between ages 25 and 55 (alive). Youngest full cohort turned 55 in 2013. 

– Baseline sample: Individuals with: Y Ymin = $1650£31 (in 2012 dollars) and oe have non-trivial income (exceeding Ymin) in 15 out of 31 years

- Uses a 1% sample of the SSA master file. Fitered for commerce and industry. Represents roughly 70% of private sector employment in 20014. 

- No discounting applied

### Not Working
Lots of people are not working. What can't the CPS tell us that this data tell us? Data show that nearly 27 percent of people who make more than 10k work less than 20 years in their lives.

Not working has real costs. And the curve is very steep. Not working 6 years on average costs people $30k annually.

### For most men, lifetime Income Has Fallen

```Lifetime income == 1/31 * sum(income from age 25-55).``` 

> Perhaps more strikingly, more than three-quarters of men have experienced no rise in their lifetime income, despite the fact that the U.S. economy has grown by more than 30% during this time.

Caveat:
>  Our data set does not contain individual-level information on non-wage benefits, but we use the NIPAs to obtain an upper bound on the growth of such benefits. Incorporating the growth in these benefits mitigates but does not overturn the results.

You can see the decline in incomes for 25 yr olds after 2000. It's mirrored as the cohorts age. The mirroring between the pink and blue dots is interesting because it suggests that 
1. The bulk of the average persons income gains occur early in the first 10 years of their career. 
2. But also those changes are highly anchored to what you made when you were 25. 

So if you made a lot relative to other cohorts when you were 25, those gains will carry on with you when you're 35. Researchers explain that this little fact explains lots of variation what people typically make their entire lives. 

I think the worthy frame here is the average joe. While Bill Gates or coding academy graduates may go from making very little money to alot of money, income in a bland, normal job is more graduated than that. Your earnings slowly accumulated.

### The two periods of lifecycle income growth: 

1957-1967: Average lifetimes incomes grew 21.9%/ median grew 12.3%

1967-1983: Average lifetimes incomes grew 1.5%/ median fell <1%

Found that income has fallen. Why? Perhaps cohorts born after 1970s spend more of their working lives during the slow growth years of 2000 and the Great Recession.


Now let's move on to women.

![women]({{site.baseurl}}/imgs/batchart-women.png)

What's interesting is how compressed these charts are. It suggest for women 25 at in 1960, approximately women born in 1935 didn't see much of a rise in income their entire lives. They could expect to see 10k in income growth their entire lives. Most of the income gains for women were generational. Women age 25 in 1980 earned $7k more than women the same age who were born in 1960. 

You can see that women entering the workforce in the late 90s started to break through. The chart fanning out suggests that their incomes started to rise much more rapidly than women in generations past. 

It's not coincidental that this spread started to take places in the mid 70s, when women birth control started to become common among women age 25 and up.

### Inequality

This is an interesting statement:

``` Cross-sectional measures of tax burden understates the lifetime burden by 2–4% for median worker. ```

1. Suggests that people throughout their lives earn more than we thought. How do people measure lifetime income with cross sectional measures. Is he talking about synthetic cohorts?

2. 
> a 25-year-old man who was at the top decile of the income distribution of his cohort in 1968 had income that was 3.3 times (P90/P10 = e1.2) the income of a man who as in the bottom decile. By the time of the last cohort, those who turned 25 in 2012, this ratio had risen rose from 3.3 to 9.0. This is a remarkable 2.7 fold rise in the P90/P10 ratio, which is higher than the total rise in the cross-sectional P90/P10 ratio for men, which went up from 4 to 10, for a rise by 2.5 fold.34

### Share of the pie by gender. 



## Lifecycle Facts


- The typical man born between 1932 and 1958 will earn a total of 1.4 million between age 25 and 55. The typical women will earn $800k. This is lifetime income. 

- Lifetime incomes have declined for men. Lifetime incomes have grown modestly for women. 

- For three quarters of Americans, this number has not changed over time. 

- It is a totally different story the top quarter. Lifetime incomes have grown a lot for the top quarter incomes for both men and women.  

- Averaged across a life, the typical man will make 40ish thousand a year; a typical woman will make between 20 and 25k. (If you averaged out the low wages you earn in your twenties with the high wages you earn in your late 50s) 

- Your biggest wage gains will happen before 35. 

- Your salary will stagnate after 45. 

- Your starting salary tends to stick with you until your mid 40s. 

- Weirdly, initial differences in wages for men will disappear by the time they turn 45 or 50. Catch up effect. Thought some of this could be selection bias. 

- But for the very rich, raises will continue well past middle age. 

- Most people will make half of their "lifetime" income by age 42. Except for the rich, they will make only 50% of all the money they will ever make at 45. 


## cross section by age. 

- Incomes for young men have steadily declined over the last 40 years. Millennial young men make less than their father and probably less than their grandfathers.

- Incomes for young women have steadily increased over the last 40 years. Millennial women make as much as their mothers, but definitely more than their grandmothers. 

- Young men and women in the silent generation make the least among the generations

- Men in the baby boom had the best starting salaries. Younger gen-Xers had the  second-best starting salaries. 

- Gen-X women had the best starting salaries


## men and women

- In the 1960, women wages were determined by when they entered the work force. 

- This started to change for women entering the workforce in the mid 80s. They started getting substantial raises in their 20s and 30s and their income curves started to resemble men's. In other words, they were developing careers. (mention goldin's and blaus work on women and careers.)

- The rising incomes can be attributed to two things: higher wages and more hours. All of the people included in the data make more than $1650 annually for 15 of 31 years, so they're at least mildly attached to the labor force. 

- For cohorts 1955-1983, men have made roughly 80% and women had made 20% of all the lifetime money. Throughout the lifetime of each cohort. 

- The gender pay gap by generation have fallen. Women used to make half as much as men. Now they make roughly 20% less. 

- But there's in an interesting pay gap within a cohort. The pay gap tends to rise in the 20s and 30s and and then decline. 

## inequality 

- Lifetime inequality is somewhat smaller that of conventional measures of inequality (if you use that baseline filter of nontrivial income).

- For men, the main driver of inequality is initial income. 

- For women, the main driver, it's the path of income.

- In other words, newer cohorts enter with much higher inequality than older cohorts, which is the main force behind rising income inequality. In 1968, a 25 year old man in the top 2 percent of income made 3.3 times as much as a 25 year old man in bottom 10 percent. By 2012 that ratio has grown to 9. 

- Can play some games like this: a 25 year old making 100k is earning more than 75% of workers at the end of their careers. (maybe too hard)

- Lifetime inequality is more extreme than conventional measures of inequality at the high end. 


## Recessions

- In between you can also see the properous periods for workers of all generations. Some good periods for people were the 80s and 90s and up to the early 90s. Why did some generation see sharper wage growth during some recessions?

- Recessions seem hurt older worker wages mores.
