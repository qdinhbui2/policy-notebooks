## Conclusions
Q1: Howmuch lifetime inequality exists in the United States today ? * A1: A lot! (relative to our prior.)

Q2: Howmuch has average lifetime income changed since the 1950s ? 
* A2: For three-quarters of population: None.

Q3: Howmuch has lifetime inequality changed since the 1950s ?
* A3: Lots of increase within gender groups. Little increase overall (thanks to shrinking lifetime gender gap!)
* A4: Most differences in income occur before age 25. 

## DATA

1. SSA Master File
	SSA Master Earnings File: Population data from1978 to 2013 – Wage/Salary income. No top coding. (SE income also available. Non-top-coded after 1993). – All workers in all 
	sectors. – Lifetime income for 6 cohorts. We combine them all in one.

2. CWHS Sample: 
	1% nationally representative panel from 1957 to 2013 (57 years). – Wage/Salary Income. Imputed above SSA taxable limit. – Commerce and Industry workers. 70% of labor force. – Lifetime (31 year) income for 27 cohorts.

Two samples:

– Sample 0: All U.S. born individuals with an SSN between ages 25 and 55 (alive). 

– Baseline sample: Individuals with: Y Ymin = $1650£31 (in 2012 dollars) and oe have non-trivial income (exceeding Ymin) in 15 out of 31 years

What does Cross sectional mean? Lifetime/Cross-sectional calculation is inteesting. Lifetime inequality for 90/10 is almost twice that when you look cross sectionally.

### Not Working
Lots of people are not working. What can't the CPS tell us that this data tell us? Data show that nearly 27 percent of people who make more than 10k work less than 20 years in their lives.

Not working has real costs. And the curve is very steep. Not working 6 years on average costs people $30k annually.

### Lifetime Income Has Fallen

```Lifetime income == 1/31 * sum(income from age 25-55).``` 

Found that income has fallen. Why? Perhaps cohorts born after 1970s spend more of their working lives during the slow growth years of 2000 and the Great Recession.

You can see the decline in incomes for 25 yr olds after 2000. It's mirrored as the cohorts age. The mirroring between the pink and blue dots is interesting because it suggests that 
1. The bulk of the average persons income gains occur early in the first 10 years of their career. 
2. But also those changes are highly anchored to what you made when you were 25. 

So if you made a lot relative to other cohorts when you were 25, those gains will carry on with you when you're 35. Researchers explain that this little fact explains lots of variation what people typically make their entire lives. 

I think the worthy frame here is the average joe. While Bill Gates or coding academy graduates may go from making very little money to alot of money, income in a bland, normal job is more graduated than that. Your earnings slowly accumulated.

Now let's move on to women.

What's interesting is how compressed these charts are. It suggest for women 25 at in 1960, approximately women born in 1935 didn't see much of a rise in income their entire lives. They could expect to see 10k in income growth their entire lives. Most of the income gains for women were generational. Women age 25 in 1980 earned $7k more than women the same age who were born in 1960. 

You can see that women entering the workforce in the late 90s started to break through. The chart fanning out suggests that their incomes started to rise much more rapidly than women in generations past. 

It's not coincidental that this spread started to take places in the mid 70s, when women birth control started to become common among women age 25 and up.


This is an interesting statement:

``` Cross-sectional measures of tax burden understates the lifetime burden by 2–4% for median worker. ```

1. Suggests that people throughout their lives earn more than we thought. How do people measure lifetime income with cross sectional measures. Is he talking about synthetic cohorts?

2. 


## Takeaways

1. What's most striking are the bat charts, by far. It's amazing to see that data in such detail. 
2. Early incomes gains are your biggest gains. They are persistent.  
3. Dropping out of the workforce is costly. The curve is very steep. 
4. Earnings for 25 year olds have dropped off. Incomes, in fact, were better then.
