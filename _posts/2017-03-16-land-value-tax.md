1. It's main feature is that the tax does not distort supply. The supply of land is fixed. Property taxes can deter development or home building--you raise the price of your property, you raise the amount you pay in taxes. 

2. Things do change. Prices for land will fall, as the prices will reflect the net present value of incoming taxation. 

3. I think it land value taxes would occur in place of property taxes?

4. I imagine higher taxes on land will translate in some way into rent prices. 

5. The problem is that most property owners are people who have single-family homes. This would be a non-starter for them. 

6. And it would be hard to assess land excluding the property ontop of that land. 

7. Path dependence reigns supreme here. A land value tax would probably be a more efficient way of taxing people, but the total social cost and uncertainty makes it hard to justify.
