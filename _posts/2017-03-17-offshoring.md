## Why do companies offshore?

[Lit review](http://www.nber.org/papers/w22041.pdf): 

> Apart from empirical puzzles, many economists care about offshoring because the
public is concerned about offshoring

Offshoring has to do with comparative advantage in both the specific tasks in each step of production but also *the costs of coordinating that complex supply chain and shipping*.

3 reasons:
1. Trade costs fall: lower tariffs and better communications
2. Comparative advanatage in skills
3. Better coordination 

### Measurement
Offshoring is implicitly about intermediate goods. 

### Theory

### Differential impact of offshoring across occupations

> Ottaviano, Peri and Wright (2013), or OPW 2013, examine the employment effects of both offshoring and immigration. The model predicts that as offshoring cost falls, employment share falls for immigrants and native-borns but rises for offshore workers, and average complexity falls for the tasks performed by immigrants but rises for those by native-borns.50
## What policies can affect offshoring?

### The paper above was really hard. [This one was easier](https://www.princeton.edu/~erossi/RO.pdf)

Moving goods aross the world is still relatively hard. Geographic specialization matter. You need to think hard about what thing you're making is. Is it computerisable? Is it codifiable? Does it require a "human touch"? If so, then its going to be hard to offshore. Delivery matters too. Some Blinder(2006) some services can't be delivered electronically now can be.
