## Why do companies offshore?

[Lit review](http://www.nber.org/papers/w22041.pdf): 

> Apart from empirical puzzles, many economists care about offshoring because the
public is concerned about offshoring

Offshoring has to do with comparative advantage in both the specific tasks in each step of production but also *the costs of coordinating that complex supply chain and shipping*.

## 3 Themes To Why Firms Offshore
 
### 1. Trade costs fall
Tariffs could fall
The ability to ship goods (or transfer work) fall


### 2. Change in comparative advantages
Countries might become relatively better (or cheaper) at doing a certain thing

### 3. Better coordination (aka Better technology)

Technology makes it easier and easier to atomize work. You can offshore tiny non-specific tasks to places where its cheaper. 

Technology makes it easier to keep tabs on workers to share loads of work


## Measurement of offshoring
Offshoring is implicitly about intermediate goods. 

Aggregate Offshoring: headline number of jobs
- Typicallly uses Input/Output tables

Narrow Offshoring: which tasks specificially?

- Hard to know firm behavior.

- Look at TAA applications, but data is limiting



## Differential impact of offshoring across occupations

[Blinder et al has some method to determine offshoring](https://www.princeton.edu/ceps/workingpapers/190blinder.pdf)

Moving goods aross the world is still relatively hard. Geographic specialization matter. You need to think hard about what thing you're making is. Is it computerisable? Is it codifiable? Does it require a "human touch"? If so, then its going to be hard to offshore. Delivery matters too. Some Blinder(2006) some services can't be delivered electronically now can be.

## Wages and Offshoring
[Simple Model on wages and offshoring](https://www.princeton.edu/~erossi/RO.pdf)
	1. Labor supply effect
	2. relative price effect
	3. productivity effect
Make an argument that when you offshore, the domestic workers benefit because the company becomes more productive and then the work that was not offshoreable that the domestic workers CAN do then become more valuable. Somewhat glosses over the fact that domestic work has to get cut to begin with. But the people left behind are more valuable.

> Ottaviano, Peri and Wright (2013), or OPW 2013, examine the employment effects of both offshoring and immigration. The model predicts that as offshoring cost falls, employment share falls for immigrants and native-borns but rises for offshore workers, and average complexity falls for the tasks performed by immigrants but rises for those by native-borns.
