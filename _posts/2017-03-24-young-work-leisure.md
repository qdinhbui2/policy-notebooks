### Let's set this thing off: Observable Facts

> Not only have hours fallen, but there is a large and growing segment of this population that has remained detached from the labor market: we document that 22 percent of less-educated younger men report working zero weeks during the prior year in 2015. The comparable number in 2000 was only 9 percent.

People talk about the lack of available opportunities for young men. That their jobs being offshored or automated, but Hurst looks at it a different way: what if they don't want to work?

Comparing time-use data from 2012-2015 to 2004-2007, Hurst finds that the decline in working hours for young men are almost equally mirrored by an increase leisure hours. Further, Hurst et al find that three quarters of those additional leisure hours are spengt playing video games. 

> We document that non-employed young men average 10 hours a week in recreational computer time, sixty percent of that spent playing video games. This exceeds the time spent on home production or socializing with friends.

### Big Question? What Causes What?

For Hurst the biggest question is: what cause what? Are men just filling their free time playing video games or are they explicitly not working because they want to play video games?

#### Demand System

In order to do this, Hurst constructs a system that maps out the elasticities of leisure, allowing you to answer this question: given a 1% increase in leisure, much much more of X will you end up doing? 

He finds that TV has an elasticity of a little over one. Which means that on average, a 1% increase in leisure will result in slightly more than 1% increase in time spent watching TV.

To give you a real life example: imagine a person who normally has 4 hours of leisure time and usually spends an hour of that watching TV.  Now imagine that his boss lets him out early and he gets an additional extra hour of leisure, raising his lesiure time 25 percent. By Hurst's calculations, that 25 percent increase in leisure time would translate into roughly a little more than 15 minutes (60 minutes *.25) of TV time. 

For young men, the elasticity for video games is 2, which means that a 25 percent increase in leisure time would equal a 50 percent increase in video game time or 30 minutes of video game time!

#### How To Compare Increase in leisure to video games

**Unpack this**

> With the estimated leisure demand system in hand, we can use the shifts over time in how leisure is allocated across various alternative activities to quantify the change in the marginal return to additional leisure. Specifically, we decompose the large increase in recreational computer use between 2004 and 2015 into a movement along the leisure Engel curve due to additional leisure time, and the shift of the expansion path due to technological improvement in computer and video games relative to other leisure goods. From this decomposition, we infer how much the marginal return to leisure increases over time due to improvements in computers and video gaming technology.

### How Do Young Men Survive and Not Work?

> We document that 70 percent of non-employed less educated young men lived with a parent or close relative in 2015, compared to 49 percent in 2000. The importance of cohabitation with a parent has been emphasized in the businesscycle context by Kaplan (2012) and Dyrda et al. (2012). 

> We document that it is also relevant 3 for the longer-run decline in employment of younger men. While government transfers are not large for young men, family transfers are substantial. To get a sense of the value of such intra-family transfers, we measure the consumption of younger men using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Specifically, we compare expenditures for households that contain young men to expenditures for all households, scaled appropriately for household size. By this measure, we see little, if any, decline in the relative consumption of younger men since 2000.
